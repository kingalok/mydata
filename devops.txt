Why devops ?

Quick Time to market.
Development, Testing and System admin all should work very quickly.
As soon as the idea is generated the application o/p should be done quickly.

All the teams try to deliver the application ( Architect, developers, QA, Proeject mgt, Business analyst, Security, system owners, etc.. )

Complex application, Developers/Testers/Admins are fighting.
Slow to market
Waste of knowledge

Example: New Mobile purchased, 1st day working, 2nd day it stops working.
We call to customer care the dev/test team is figting and will inform you ?
Custoer will run away....
